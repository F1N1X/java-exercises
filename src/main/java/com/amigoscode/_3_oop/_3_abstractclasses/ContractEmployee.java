// TODO: 5 - Create a ContractEmployee class that extends Employee.
//   - Add two private fields: hourlyRate (double) and hoursWorked (int)
//   - Constructor takes name, hourlyRate, and hoursWorked
//     (pass name and 0.0 as baseSalary to super)
//   - Implement calculatePay() to return hourlyRate * hoursWorked
